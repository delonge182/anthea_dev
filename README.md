# anthea_dev
Anthea is a software that can be used to optimize vehicles routes for logistic and transportation operation. It was developed using Java for the backend (model, controller, algorithm) and EXT JS (with DJN) for front end.
The optimization algorithm was based on Dijkstra, randomized algorithm, and custom backtracking. The objective of this project is to reduce operational cost by having shortest trip duration accumulated.

# This project consists of:
- All Java files where the all the business processes were implemented. Including the data model, algorithms, etc.
- All the Javascript files where all the user interfaces were implemented. 

# Notes:
This project will only available for a **limited time** and the purpose is as a **showcase** of my experience with Java and Javascript.
This project doesn't include any required Java and Javascript library, so it **can't be built or deployed**.
